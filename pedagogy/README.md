#### 1. Focus Area : Heat and Mass Transfer (Thermal Engineering)
By this experiment ,  we want students to understand the the heat transfer mechanism in heat pipe. By doing this experiment , they will analyse that heat transfer rate is very high in heat pipe.

#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> First students have to switch on the power and set the appropriate voltage and current readings. This power supply will heat up the . After the heating temperatures would be developed on surfaces of all 3 rods.
###### Assessment Method:: Assessment could be done on the basis of viva-voce. 

<u> <b>Description: </b> In simulator 3 rods are taken .at one end of all 3 rods an electric heater is provided and at other end reservoir which contains cooling water is connected.When the simulator starts and voltage and current value will be provided then heating would be started and on the basis of the heat transfer rate in all three rods , simulator will provide temperature value along the rods and cooling water . </u>

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| LO1 | Student will supply power to all three rods. | Heat pipe is widely used now a days because 
<br> a) It acts as an insulator <br> b) It acts as conductor and insulator <br> c) It acts as an superconductor <br> d) It acts as a fin.

2.| LO2,LO3 | Student will wait for the steady state and after that note down the value of temperature at different surfaces. | 1 The working principle of Heat pipe is<br> A. a) Evaporation-Condensation cycle. <br> B.a) Evaporation-Condensation cycle. <br> C.c) Fouriers Law of Conduction <br> <b> D. d) Newtons Law of cooling </b> <br> (mark correct option as bold text)

3.| LO1.LO2,LO3 |Observe that temperature of water in reservoir connected at other end of heat pipe is higher than that of Cu rod and Stainless steel rod. | Heat pipes are not used in which of the following <br> A.Spacecrafts <br> B.Computer systems <br> Nuclear power cnversion <br> Boiler

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Activity description <br> Student will switch on the power button | Click on the ‘Tart Button '  | The main purpose is to provide power supply to the apparatus
2.| Activity description <br> Student will set the appropriate value of voltage and current | Click on the ‘voltage and current rheostat   '  | The main purpose is to provide appropriate amount of heat to the workpiece (Q=VI).
3.| Activity description <br> Student will wait for the steady state and note down the temperature | Click on the ‘Temperature value be displayed '  | The main purpose is to observe the temperature values at different point along the three points on the rod and temperature of water in reservoirs available at ends of all three rods.
