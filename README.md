<b> Experiment|     <b> CONVECTION-Heat Pipe Convection Experiment

<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

Heat and Mass Transfer lab is introduced into fifth semester of course B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering. The main objective of this lab is to determine the heat transfer rates for  heat transfer processes like Conduction , Convection and Radiation to examine the methods to achieve desired rate of heat transfer in various types thermal systems and heat exchangers.

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

To demonstrate the super thermal conductivity of heat pipe and to compare its working with best conductor i.e Cu pipe ans Stainless Steel pipe.To verify that heat transfer rate for heat pipe is higher than other available metals in industry

<h5> Target Audience : </h5>

Third year UG  Students and faculties of Mechanical Engineering

<h5> Course Alignment : </h5>

B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering)

<h5> Universities Mapped : </h5>

Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam Technical University(AKTU)
