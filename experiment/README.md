### Aim
To demonstrate the super thermal conductivity of heat pipe and to compare its working with best conductor i.e Cu pipe ans Stainless Steel pipe.
### Theory
A heat pipe is a device that combine the high efficiency boiling and condensation. It is apptly named because it is pipe heat from hot region to cold one. It is a simple device with no moving parts that can transfer large quantities of heat over fairly large distance essentially at a constant temperature without requiring any power output. It is composed of three sections : the evaporator section at one end, Where heat is absorbed and the fluid is vaporized, the condenser section at the other end , Where vapor is condensed and heat is rejected and the adiabatic section in between , Where the vapor and the liquid phase of the fluid flow in opposite direction through the core and wick, Respectively to the complete cycle with no significant heat transfer between the fluid and the surrounding medium. The pipe is a tube that can be bent and turned anyway that is convinient 
The inside of the tube is lines with a layer of wicking material. The wick is wetted with an appropriate liquid. One end of the tube is exposed to the heat source that evaporate the liquid from the wick. The vapor then flow from hot end of the tube to the cold end, where it is condensed. Capillary action moves the condensed liquid axially along the wick, back to the evaporater where it is again vaporized
Placing a heat pipe between the hot region and the cold one is thus similar to connecting the regions with a material of extremely high thermal conductivity – potentially orders of magnitude higher then the solid material. Such devices are used not only for achieving high heat transfer rate between a source and a sink but for a variety of less obvious purpose. They are used for example to level out the temperature in system, since they function isothermally and offer very little and thermal resistance. Heat pipes are particularly useful in energy conversion equipment where it is desired to recover heat from hot gases for air preheat and supplemental heating applications. In some cases the heat pipe can take place of more costly combination of pumps, piping and dual heat exchanger configuration. 
### Apparatus Required
	Heat pipe , Copper Tube, Stainless steel tube of equal length.
	3 band type heaters, 2 Condensers( water reservoirs)
	Voltmeter,Ammeter
	12 temperature sensors, Temperature Indicator
### Procedure
Step1: Close the drain valve of condenser tank.and fill equal amount of waterin three condenser tanks so that pipe is submerged completely in water.
Step2: Switch on main ON/OFF switch.
Step3: Set the heater input by dimmerstat, voltmeter in the range of 40 to 100 V.

Step4: After 15 min note down the readings of voltmeter , ammeter and temperature sensors in observation table after every 10 minutes interval 
Step5: After experiment is over ,set dimmerstat to zero , switch off the main supply and drain water from condenser.
