## Storyboard (Round 2)

Delete this line before submission : The core principle of Round 2 is to make the lab/experiment documentation elaborated in a manner that it makes easy for any person (developer/domain and non domain faculty/student) to understand and develop the lab/experiment.

Experiment 1:To demonstrate the super thermal conductivity of heat pipe and to compare its working with best conductor i.e Cu pipe ans Stainless Steel pipe

### 1. Story Outline:

This Experiment contains 3 rods I.e. heat pipe, copper rod and stainless steel rod. At one end of all three rods band heater is attached. 3 temperature sensors measure temperature along the length of pipe for each rod and one temperature sensor measure the temperature of water in the reservoir attached to each rod.

### 2. Story:

When power is supplied to band heaters . one end of all three rods gets heated. Heat starts flowing from heater end to condenser end . hence temperature at specified locations along the rods increases. Also temperature of water in all three condenser also increases. We measure temperatures of all 12 temperature sensors after 10 minutes. If it is found that temperature of water in the condenser attached to heat pipe is higher than temperature of other two condensers, it means heat transfer rate for heat pipe is higher than other two rods.

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
In the simulator user will be able to see the virtual prototype of experimental set up resembling the actual experimental set up that is present in real time labs. In the set up there control panel which houses voltmeter, ammeter, temperture indicator , dimmerstat ,mains switch and a table on which 3 rods alond with heater at one end and condensers at other end are mounted.

#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
1.	By this experiment student will be able to recall basics of heat transfer
2.	This experiment will describe the application of heat pipe
3.	Student will be able to understand the relation between temperature gradient and heat flow rate.
4.	Student will be able to recall the basic concepts of conduction and convection.


#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

1.	In the experimental set up, there is electric power supply. User will start the electric supply by pressing start botton
2.	User can change the value of voltmeter by using dimmerstat
3.	For a particular power supply , readings of temperature indicators can be noted down.


##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:


##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:
1.	If user doesn't allow 10 minutes heating before measuring temperature to develop then 
##### 2.6 Conclusion:
User will take approximate 7-10 minutes for understanding the procedure. Then for generating data by the help of simulator will take 3-5 minutes. In this along with generation of data student will be able to verify that heat flow rate for heat pipe is higher than copper rod and stainless steel rod.After onwards for calculating result will take 5 minutes. Hence total time taken for doing experiment will be approximately 10 minutes.

(guide :The lab proposer should extract logic from the story, prepare a flowchart from the story narration and write the algorithm to execute the black box.  use Google Drawings https://docs.google.com/drawings/ (send the link to your flowchart and also attach .png by exporting it )


### 5. Storyboard :
Step1: Close the drain valve of condenser tank.and fill equal amount of waterin three condenser tanks so that pipe is submerged completely in water.
Step2: Switch on main ON/OFF switch.
Step3: Set the heater input by dimmerstat, voltmeter in the range of 40 to 100 V.

Step4: After 15 min note down the readings of voltmeter , ammeter and temperature sensors in observation table after every 10 minutes interval 
Step5: After experiment is over ,set dimmerstat to zero , switch off the main supply and drain water from condenser.
