<b> Lab | <b> Heat and Mass Transfer
<b> Experiment|     <b> To demonstrate the super thermal conductivity of heat pipe and to compare its working with best conductor i.e Cu pipe ans Stainless Steel pipe

### 1. Story Outline:
The main objective of this compare thermal conductivity of all 3 rods (Heat Pipe,Copper rod and Stainless steel rod). At one end of all three rods band heater is attached. 3 temperature sensors measure temperature along the length of pipe for each rod and one temperature sensor measure the temperature of water in the reservoir attached to each rod.  
### 2. Story:

The electric power is supplied to a circular electric heater. This electric heater will convert this electric power into thermal power(heat). When power is supplied to band heaters . one end of all three rods gets heated. Heat starts flowing from heater end to condenser end . hence temperature at specified locations along the rods increases. Also temperature of water in all three condenser also increases. Thermocouples T1, T2,T3 measures the temperature along heat pipe and T4 measures the temperature o water in reservoir connected to other end of heat pipe. Thermocouples T5, T6,T7  measures the temperature along heat pipe and T8 measures the temperature o water in reservoir connected to other end of  copper rod . Thermocouples T9, T10, T11 measures the temperature along heat pipe and T12 measures the temperature o water in reservoir connected to other end of stainless steel. We measure temperatures of all 12 temperature sensors after 10 minutes. If it is found that 
	Temperature of water in the condenser attached to heat pipe is higher than temperature of other two condensers.
	Temperture gradient dT/dx is lower for heat pipe as compared to Stainless steel and copper rod.
It means heat transfer rate for heat pipe is higher than other two rods.

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
1. In the simulator user will be able to see the virtual prototype of experimental set up resembling the actual experimental set up that is present in real time labs.
2. Composite wall Set up Contains 
	Control panel which houses voltmeter, ammeter, temperature indicator , dimmer-stat ,mains switch. When user switches on the mains ,red light will diaplay to inform the user electric power is supplied to set up.
	Table on which 3 rods(hear pipe, stainless steel and copper) are placed. At one end of all 3 rods bend heaters are connected and .at other end of all three rods reservoirs are connected. Electric connections are made between band heaters and control panel , thermocoples and control panel.
3.	Book icon on top of right side which contains instructions to run the simulator.
4.	Sand-witch icon on top of left side to set the values of input voltage and current.When user provides the input voltage and current values, user will be able to see the movement of pointer in voltmeter and ammeter to input value. This will give him feeling of real life apparatus.


#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
1.	By this experiment User will be able to recall basics of heat transfer
2.	This experiment will describe the application of heat pipe
3.	User will be able to understand the relation between temperature gradient and heat flow rate.
4.	User will be able to understand the basic concepts of 1- D Steady state conduction.


#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:
1.  In the experimental set up , there is a book icon at right top. Press book icon available at top of right side and user will read the Instruction
2. There is a main switch and start the machine button. User will start the electric supply by pressing start button or by turning on the main switch. A red light will be turned on to show power is supplied to heater.
3.There is sandwitch icon at top of left side of simulator.click sandwitch button available at top of left side.Set the values of Voltage and Ammeter .Wait for 10 minutes so that steady state condition develops.
4. After providing input power, show results tab appears on screen. Click Show Results.Note Down the Temperature value at different points
5. After noting down temperature reading, find out the temperature gradient.

##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:
Q 1. The function of wick structure is
a) To generate temperature difference
<b>b) To generate capillary pressure</b>
c) To transfer heat
d) To obstruct the flow
##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:
1.	If user doesn't allow 10 minutes heating before measuring temperature to develop then steady state will not prevail.
##### 2.6 Conclusion:
User will take approximate 2-3 minutes for understanding the procedure. Then for generating data by the help of simulator will take 2-3 minutes. In this along with generation of data student will be able to verify the basics of 1-D steady state heat conduction and heat and heat pipe.Time taken for doing experiment will be approximately 11 minutes.
